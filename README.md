Comparitive Study of Controllers for Quadrotor trajectory tracking


This project presents a comparison of Geometric controller, LQR, and MPC controller applied to a quadrotor. Quadrotors are used in a wide range of applications from surveillance to delivery, and selecting an optimal controller would help make each situation more efficient. Geometric controller is based on differential flatness and transforms quadrotor dynamics into flat outputs, enabling trajectory tracking. LQR is a classic controller that utilizes a linearized model to optimize control gains. MPC is a model-based controller that considers the quadrotor's dynamics and future predictions to optimize control actions. Python software is used to model the dynamics as well as for the simulation of the drone.
